## Detection of Facial Deepfake images using CNN Architecture

- Built a User Friendly Facial DeepFake detection system with DenseNet121 architecture.<br>
- Achieved a deepfake detection accuracy of 95.16%.<br>

## Project Explanation :

-Model Architecture: DenseNet121, a pre-trained CNN model, is used as the core architecture for classification.

 DenseNet121 Architecture:

- DenseNet121: A densely connected convolutional network where each layer is connected to every other layer, ensuring efficient feature reuse.
- Pre-trained on: ImageNet dataset, enabling transfer learning for deepfake detection.
